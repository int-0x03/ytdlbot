# Usage

[https://t.me/benny_ytdlbot](https://t.me/benny_ytdlbot)

Send link directly to the bot. Any
Websites [supported by youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) will also work.

# Limitations of my bot

I don't have unlimited servers and bandwidth, so I have to make some restrictions.

* 5 GiB one-way traffic per 24 hours for each user
* maximum 5 minutes streaming conversion support
* maximum 3 subscriptions
* limited request in certain time range

You can choose to become 'VIP' if you really need large traffic. And also, you could always deploy your own bot.

# Features

# How to deploy?

You can deploy this bot on any platform that supports Python.

## Heroku

Use the button above! It should work like a magic but with limited functionalities.

## Run natively on your machine

1. clone code
2. install ffmpeg
3. install Python 3.6+
4. install aria2 and add to PATH
5. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6. set environment variables `TOKEN`, `APP_ID` and `APP_HASH`, and more if you like.
7. `python3 ytdl_bot.py`

## Docker

Some functions, such as VIP, ping will be disabled.

```shell
docker run -e APP_ID=111 -e APP_HASH=111 -e TOKEN=370FXI bennythink/ytdlbot
```

# Complete deployment guide for docker-compose

* contains every functionality
* compatible with amd64, arm64 and armv7l

## 1. get docker-compose.yml

Download `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory

## 2. create data directory

```shell
mkdir data
mkdir env
```

## 3. configuration

### 3.1. set environment variables

```shell
vim env/ytdl.env
```

you can configure all the following environment variables:

* PYRO_WORKERS: number of workers for pyrogram, default is 100
* WORKERS: workers count for celery
* APP_ID: **REQUIRED**, get it from https://core.telegram.org/
* APP_HASH: **REQUIRED**
* TOKEN: **REQUIRED**
* REDIS: **REQUIRED if you need VIP mode and cache** ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't publish your redis server on the internet. ‚ö†Ô∏è

* OWNER: owner username
* QUOTA: quota in bytes
* EX: quota expire time
* MULTIPLY: vip quota comparing to normal quota
* USD2CNY: exchange rate
* VIP: VIP mode, default: disable
* AFD_LINK
* COFFEE_LINK
* COFFEE_TOKEN
* AFD_TOKEN
* AFD_USER_ID

* AUTHORIZED_USER: users that could use this bot, user_id, separated with `,`
* REQUIRED_MEMBERSHIP: group or channel username, user must join this group to use the bot. Could be use with
  above `AUTHORIZED_USER`

* ENABLE_CELERY: Distribution mode, default: disable. You'll can setup workers in different locations.
* ENABLE_FFMPEG: enable ffmpeg so Telegram can stream
* MYSQL_HOST: you'll have to setup MySQL if you enable VIP mode
* MYSQL_USER
* MYSQL_PASS
* GOOGLE_API_KEY: YouTube API key, required for YouTube video subscription.
* AUDIO_FORMAT: audio format, default is m4a. You can set to any known and supported format for ffmpeg. For
  example,`mp3`, `flac`, etc. ‚ö†Ô∏è m4a is the fastest. Other formats may affect performance.
* ARCHIVE_ID: group or channel id/username. All downloads will send to this group first and then forward to end user.
* PLAYLIST_SUPPORT: `True` or `False`, Ability to enable or disable downloads of playlist / channels by bot. Default: `False`.
  **Inline button will be lost during the forwarding.**

## 3.2 Set up init data

If you only need basic functionality, you can skip this step.

### 3.2.1 Create MySQL db

Required for VIP, settings, YouTube subscription.

```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec mysql bash

mysql -u root -p

> create database ytdl;
```

### 3.2.2 Setup flower db in `ytdlbot/ytdlbot/data`

Required if you enable celery and want to monitor the workers.

```shell
{} ~ python3
Python 3.9.9 (main, Nov 21 2021, 03:22:47)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dbm;dbm.open("flower","n");exit()
```

### 3.2.3 Setup instagram cookies

Required if you want to support instagram.

You can use this extension
[Get cookies.txt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid)
to get instagram cookies

```shell
vim  data/instagram.com_cookies.txt
# paste your cookies
```

## 3.3 Tidy docker-compose.yml

In `flower` service section, you may want to change your basic authentication username password and publish port.

You can also limit CPU and RAM usage by adding an `deploy' key:

```docker
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 1500M
```

Be sure to use `--compatibility` when deploying.

## 4. run

### 4.1. standalone mode

If you only want to run the mode without any celery worker and VIP mode, you can just start `ytdl` service

```shell
docker-compose up -d ytdl
```

### 4.2 VIP mode

You'll have to start MySQL and redis to support VIP mode, subscription and settings.

```
docker-compose up -d mysql redis ytdl
```

### 4.3 Celery worker mode

Firstly, set `ENABLE_CELERY` to true. And then, on one machine:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

On the other machine:

```shell
docker-compose -f worker.yml up -d
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Bear in mind don't publish redis directly on the internet! You can use WireGuard to wrap it up.**
